sorter.sh - simple bash script for sorting huge GB/TB text files

sorting phases:
-splitting
-sort splitted parts
-merge sorted parts

script not configurable, but may be necessary to fix paths to sort
and split binaries, check correspond lines in sorter.sh.

usage:
	./sorter.sh $0 max_lines filename result_filename
	
options: 
	max_lines - number of lines for file splitting
	filename  - input file (not sorted)
	result_filename - output file (sorted result)

usage example:
	./sorter.sh 1600000 items sorted_items 
	
as result in current folder, will be created a number of files:

- unsorted parts:
part00000
...
part0000N
 
- sorted parts:
part00000.sorted
...
part0000N.sorted

- result file (merged sort parts), see above result_filename
